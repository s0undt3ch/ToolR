# Toolr

A tool, similar to [invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) and also the next generation of [python-tools-scripts](https://github.com/saltstack/python-tools-scripts).

The goal is to quickly enable projects to write a python module under the project's ``tools/`` sub-directory and it
automatically becomes a sub command to the ``toolr`` CLI.
