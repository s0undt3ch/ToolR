## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any issues you may find.

### How to Report

1. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature that can be
found [here](https://github.com/s0undt3ch/toolr/security/advisories/new).

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### Response Timeline

We are committed to addressing security issues promptly:

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the vulnerability within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Critical vulnerabilities will be patched within 30 days, other issues within 90 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on public disclosure timing after the fix is available

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. Please allow us reasonable time to investigate and fix the vulnerability before public disclosure
2. We will work with you to understand the scope and impact
3. We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
4. We will publish security advisories for confirmed vulnerabilities

### Security Best Practices
